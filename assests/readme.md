This weather API allows you to look at a 6-day forecast of the city, displaying a few key pieces of data along with it. It uses the API to gain access to the longitude and latitude based on the input of city names to retrieve data from the API. From that, it will display 5 days of data (city name, city date, icon of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity). The API also stores local data so you can pick from the prompted search history.
